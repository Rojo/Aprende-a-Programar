# Here's a tougher question: If I am 1031 million seconds old, how old am I am?

# The age is 1,031,000,000 seconds old
# 60 seconds are in a minute
# 60 minutes are in an hour
# 24 hours are in a day
# 365 days are in a year

# Then: 1,031,000,000 seconds / 60 sec / 60 min / 24 hours / 365 days
puts 1_031_000_000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365
